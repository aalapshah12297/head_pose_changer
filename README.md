# Head Pose Changer
A simple MATLAB script with a GUI that provides functionality to slightly tilt the pose of the head in a given image. Developed as a course project for EE604@IITK (Image Processing).

For an explanation of the procedure used, see `Head Pose Changer - Presentation.pdf`.

Facial landmark detection is performed using the MATLAB interface to dlib provided by [this repository](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/find_face_landmarks/releases).

## Instructions
1. Replace `test_images/001.jpg` with your own image. (Or change the MATLAB script to load the image from a custom location.)
2. Run `head_pose_changer.m` and follow the on-screen instructions (read the figure titles).
3. The results should look like the demo shown in `Head Pose Changer - Demo.pdf`.
